Improving your website conversion rate can greatly increase sales and revenue with little or no effort, you only need to understand how your visitors use your website and optimize accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, I&#8217;m\u00a0going to show you 5 inexpensive ways to improve your website conversion rate using only a handful of free online tools and techniques to help you make the most out of your website in 2019 but first, let&#8217;s define what a website conversion rate is and how to calculate it.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a Website Conversion Rate?<\/h3>\n<p>A website or landing page conversion rate is the percentage of people who perform an expected action on your website versus the total number of visitors.<\/p>\n<p>The formula\u00a0can be written like this: <strong>(# of visitors who completed an action) \/ (total # of visitors) * 100<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>This percentage can be anywhere from 1% to as much as 15% or even higher. It&#8217;s not unusual\u00a0to see some websites or landing page performing better than others based on their set KPI&#8217;s, but keeping an eye on your conversion rate can help you optimize your website to constantly improve your website conversion rate.<\/p>\n<p>Before we get started, it&#8217;s important that you first define your website&#8217;s key performance index (KPI). We&#8217;ve had clients walk up to us with a website design request without defining their KPI, so if you&#8217;re also struggling to find the right KPI for your website, here are a few to consider.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Newsletter Signup<\/li>\n<li>Downloading a free resource like an EBook, trial software, music tracks etc.<\/li>\n<li>Filling out a contact form<\/li>\n<li>Buying a product<\/li>\n<li>Reading an article<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Whatever you consider as your website&#8217;s key performance index, be sure to clearly state it out at the very beginning so it can properly be optimized for. With that out of the way, let&#8217;s get to the business of the day and show you how to improve your website conversion rate.<\/p>\n<h3>#1 Improve Design and Visual Appeal<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s a no-brainer that beautifully designed websites or landing pages perform better than their\u00a0poorly\u00a0designed counterparts. Even if you don&#8217;t have an eye for design, a quick 5-minute research to see what your competitor&#8217;s website or landing page looks like can ignite your creativity.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_163\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-163\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-163 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/2021\/clickmedia\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/houses-ui-large-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/houses-ui-large-1.jpeg 800w, https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/houses-ui-large-1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/houses-ui-large-1-768x576.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-163\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: collectui.com by Vladimir Biondic<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Use contrasting colours to emphasize\u00a0important sections of your website like special offers, call-to-action buttons and newsletter signup forms.\u00a0\u00a0Conversions depend on many factors, but the actual appearance of your site and the feeling it gives people has a lot to do with whether or not they take action. Something as simple as using contrasting colours can make a big difference in the long run.<\/p>\n<h3>#2 Create Landing Pages<\/h3>\n<p>Landing pages are a great way to improve website conversion rate. It&#8217;s a page on your website with content that addresses one specific area of your business, service or product. It should include a single call to action. Its entire purpose is to capture your visitor&#8217;s contact information or make a sale.<\/p>\n<p>A specific landing page and call to action is more relevant to the visitor\u2019s needs than your homepage and is more likely to convert.<\/p>\n<h3>#3 Use Clear Call To Action<\/h3>\n<p>A clear call to action (CTA) is a good way to have your visitors take immediate action on your website. Whether you want them to watch a video, download or try a product for free or signup for your newsletter, using clear and concise call-to-action buttons with contrasting colours can greatly improve your conversion rate.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_164\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-164\" style=\"width: 1369px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-164 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/2021\/clickmedia\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/moz-landing-page-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1369\" height=\"956\" srcset=\"https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/moz-landing-page-1.png 1369w, https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/moz-landing-page-1-300x209.png 300w, https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/moz-landing-page-1-1024x715.png 1024w, https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/moz-landing-page-1-768x536.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1369px) 100vw, 1369px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-164\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">MOZ.com landing page<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>You can see an example of using high-contrast colours found on Moz.com landing page.
