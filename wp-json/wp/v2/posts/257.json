Information Resource<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A website serves as an online digital brochure for your business, conveying your services and products to the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think for a second how this can impact your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers get to see your products and services without giving you a call.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guiding the customer through your services and helping them take immediate decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount of information you can have on a single website is limitless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can have as many information as you want but <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_tiny gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">i<\/g> highly recommend answering the following questions in detail as a starting point;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Who you are<\/li><li>What you do<\/li><li>Contact Information<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Lead Generation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lead generation is very important for business growth and the most cost effective way to generate leads is through your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you want people to sign up for your monthly newsletter, fill out a contact form, RSVP for a seminar or request a callback, your website can help you achieve this and much more in a seamless and <g class=\"gr_ gr_115 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"115\" data-gr-id=\"115\">cost effective<\/g> way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several ways to implement a lead generation strategy that is specific to your business goals but without a website, you could just as well be throwing money away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lead generation with a proper digital marketing strategy can propel your business to another level<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Digital Marketing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Promoting your business through online and offline media without a website is money wasted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People need a place where they can find more information about your business and as you already know, your website is a great information resource tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So whether you plan to <a href=\"http:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/online-marketing-guide-for-beginners\/\">promote your business on Social Media<\/a> or print promotional flyers, be sure to have a website that clearly describes your business in detail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with online marketing or what it can do for your business, please checkout our guide on <a href=\"http:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/online-marketing-guide-for-beginners\/\">how to do online marketing&nbsp;for&nbsp;small&nbsp;business.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Brand Trust and Loyalty<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a website can help build brand trust and loyalty with your customers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People start to see you as a serious business and that alone helps them trust  your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A professionally designed website with relevant content that answers your customer questions is an invaluable tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So whether you are a small business owner or an individual who offers a particular service, having a website helps build a relationship based on trust with your customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Google Search (SEO)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With over 3.5 billion daily searches on Google alone, the chances of people finding your business on Google is zero if you don&#8217;t have a website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More people are turning to Google search to find information and services of interest on a daily basis. Just take a look at the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"live statistics here (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http:\/\/www.internetlivestats.com\/google-search-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\">live search statistics here.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only way to get onboard is by having your own website and letting Google find you so other people can find you as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen people say <strong><em>&#8220;Oh, i don&#8217;t need a website, i have an Instagram page to promote my business&#8221;<\/em><\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, your customers won&#8217;t go to Instagram to search for you, they will most likely go to Google.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want people to find your business online through Google, hire a web designer today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. Cost-effective sales team<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>How many sales people do you need to hit your bottom line on a daily, monthly and yearly basis?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t answer that for you but i can only imagine it&#8217;s a lot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A website doubles as a salesperson and secretary, providing helpful information about your business and services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By utilising basic online marketing strategies to drive traffic to your website, you can convert more visitors to customers using the sales person and secretary approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A well designed website can save you the cost in hiring more salespeople to help drive your bottom line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7. 24\/7 Customer Support and Engagement<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A website gives your business round the clock visibility and ability to engage with customers while you sleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can greatly impact your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers can fill out your contact form to request your services, grab your phone number, lodge a complaint and find answers to their question round the clock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one area where your website truly outshines your customer support team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an inexpensive way to constantly engage with your customers without the need to be physically present.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone looking for more information about your business simply goes to your website and voila! <strong><em>Problem solved!<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8. Operational Cost Management<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a website can greatly reduce the cost of running your business by delegating customer support and sales services to the website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, promoting your business online through social media and other forms of online marketing is a huge cost saver when compared to the conventional types of advertising like billboards, TV commercials and much more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your website works round the clock, no holidays, no call-in-sick moments, no gimmicks. It simply works and helps your customers answer relevant questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9. Efficient Business Operations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A well designed website can help you run your business operations more efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the most relevant informations are already on your website, customers would have had their minds halfway made up before contacting you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So rather than spending more time on the phone pitching your services, you instead, help your customers make the right decisions to land a sale when they contact you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>10. Increase Business Visibility, Awareness and Reach<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having your own website can greatly increase your business awareness, visibility and reach. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By developing a good content and marketing strategy on a well-designed search engine optimized website, people searching for your services can easily find you thereby increasing your reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can all agree that more visibility and reach equals more opportunity to land a sale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To conclude, the benefits of having a website for your business far outweighs what has been mentioned here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you read this article all the way and you&#8217;re still struggling to understand why your business needs a website, let me quickly list out the take-home points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A good website will help your business;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Become more efficient<\/li><li>Build customer trust and loyalty<\/li><li>Increase sales<\/li><li>Increase awareness and reach<\/li><li>Generate new leads<\/li><li>And finally, help more people find your business through Google search.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have any further questions on why your business needs a website, please ask me in the comment section below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d be glad to help out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The importance of website for business growth is unquestionable.
