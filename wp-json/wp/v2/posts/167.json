thing is you can set up your business name, give a brief description of your business, opening hours, business address, website link etc.<\/p>\n<p>The setup is very straightforward and most of you shouldn&#8217;t have a problem with it.<\/p>\n<h3>Labels<\/h3>\n<p>Labels are a great way to organize your contact and messages so you can easily keep track of them.<\/p>\n<figure

cool feature on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whatsapp.com\/business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WhatsApp Business<\/a> App.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_172\"

id=\"caption-attachment-172\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">WhatsApp Business quick replies set up<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>They are a great way to store snippets of reusable messages for quick replies.<\/p>\n<p>A good example will be <strong>&#8220;Thank you for your order, you will be notified once your product has been shipped&#8221;.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Imagine having to type that every single time you make a sale, exhausting isn&#8217;t it.<\/p>\n<p>Quick replies are very easy to set up and access on the app.<\/p>\n<p>I encourage you to set up as many quick replies as possible cos it will save you a lot of time and money.<\/p>\n<h3>Automated Messages<\/h3>\n<p>Imagine being away from your phone and a customer sends you a message.<\/p>\n<p>Or, you&#8217;re in transit without access to the internet and a message comes in from a customer.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_170\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-170\" style=\"width: 740px\" class=\"wp-caption

don&#8217;t have access to your phone.<\/p>\n<p>You can also create a greeting message to introduce your customer to your product.<\/p>\n<p>We all know that a quick response to a customers enquiry and greatly improve your chances of landing a sale.<\/p>\n<p>This feature is actually my favourite, it is similar to a phone voicemail set up that allows you to leave a message while away from your phone.<\/p>\n<h3>Messaging Statistics<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whatsapp.com\/business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WhatsApp Business<\/a> app gives you a great way to track your messages.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine being able to track how many messages you have sent, how many messages were successfully delivered and how many messages were read, how cool is that?<\/p>\n<p>It is such a great way to get an overview of how well you are communicating with your customers.<\/p>\n<h3>What you need to get started<\/h3>\n<p>The obvious answer is an Android smartphone, internet access and a dedicated phone number for your business.<\/p>\n<p>As you may have\u00a0guessed, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whatsapp.com\/business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WhatsApp Business<\/a> is only available officially on the Android platform as at the time of writing.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a dual sim Android smartphone, you&#8217;re in luck.<\/p>\n<p>The WhatsApp and WhatsApp Business app are two different applications so you can run simultaneously on your dual sim smartphone.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_169\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-169\" style=\"width: 740px\"

class=\"wp-caption-text\">WhatsApp and WhatsApp Business app on an android phone<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>If you are already using WhatsApp on your business line, you can still download WhatsApp Business and move your profile.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see, I said: <strong>&#8220;move&#8221;\u00a0<\/strong>and not <em>register<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>This is the only available option WhatsApp Business gives to you as you can only register one phone number per WhatsApp application.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have WhatsApp Business installed on your smartphone, you are now ready to take advantage of all the productive features.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have a dual sim phone, you might consider buying a dedicated smartphone for your business.<\/p>\n<p>Trust me, you will not regret it.<\/p>\n<h3>Where can I download WhatsApp Business app?<\/h3>\n<p>To download the WhatsApp Business app, visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.whatsapp.w4b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Play store<\/a> and search for WhatsApp Business.<\/p>\n<p>If you are like me, very impatient, <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.whatsapp.w4b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">just click here and that should lead you to the Google Play store<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Once the app has been downloaded and installed, it is time to set it up.<\/p>\n<h3>How to set up WhatsApp Business?<\/h3>\n<p>If you already have a business line that is set up for WhatsApp, make sure you backup your chats to Google Drive so you don&#8217;t lose them.<\/p>\n<p>To back up your chats, go to <strong>Settings<\/strong> &gt; <strong>Chats<\/strong> &gt; <strong>Chat backup<\/strong> and click on <strong>Back up.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This should backup your chats to Google Drive.<\/p>\n<h4>Step 1 &#8211; Phone number set up<\/h4>\n<p>If your phone number was previously registered on WhatsApp, you will be prompted to move your profile.<\/p>\n<p>You will be required to verify your phone number using a verification code sent via SMS to your phone.<\/p>\n<p>If your phone number has never been registered on WhatsApp, you can register and verify your phone number.<\/p>\n<h4>Step 2 &#8211; Business profile set up<\/h4>\n<p>Once all the verifications have taken place, you can then set up your business profile.<\/p>\n<p>This also is very straightforward, just provide your business name, choose a category and enter a brief description.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a website, you can provide it in the available box. If not, just enter your Facebook, Instagram or Twitter link.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can leave it blank but I&#8217;d advice you use any of the social media platforms you use in promoting your business.<\/p>\n<p>You can also set up your business opening hours and address if you want to provide that information.<\/p>\n<p>To edit your business profile settings at any time, go to <strong>Settings<\/strong> &gt; <strong>Business settings<\/strong> &gt; <strong>Profile.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4>Step 3 &#8211; Automated Messages<\/h4>\n<p>I highly recommend setting up an automated response.<\/p>\n<p>This is especially useful when you are without your phone or out of network coverage.<\/p>\n<p>WhatsApp Business provides you with a default message but it might not be what you want to tell your customers.<\/p>\n<p>To set up your automated message, go to <strong>Settings<\/strong> &gt;<strong> Business settings<\/strong> &gt; <strong>Away message.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You can also set up your greeting message and quick replies while you are at it.<\/p>\n<p>The greeting message is very useful when customers contact you for the first time or after 14 days of inactivity.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a quick way to respond to customer assuming you are busy.<\/p>\n<p>Your greeting message can simply be a quick introduction to your business or any message to keep them engaged.<\/p>\n<p>To set up your greeting message, go to\u00a0<strong>Settings<\/strong> &gt;<strong> Business settings<\/strong> &gt; <strong>Greeting\u00a0message.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4>Step 4 &#8211; Quick Replies<\/h4>\n<p>As I mentioned above, quick replies can save you a lot of time and money.<\/p>\n<p>My advice to you is to write down a few snippets of text that might come in handy.<\/p>\n<p>These can be simple thank you messages or a list of services or products you offer.<\/p>\n<p>Trust me, it will come in handy as your contact list grows.<\/p>\n<p>To set up your greeting message, go to\u00a0<strong>Settings<\/strong> &gt;<strong> Business settings<\/strong> &gt; <strong>Quick replies.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To use quick replies in your message, simply start your message with a forward slash (\/) and all your saved quick replies will pop up.<\/p>\n<p>As you already can tell, the convenience of chatting with your customers on the go can greatly improve your sales.<\/p>\n<p>I encourage you to use WhatsApp Business if you currently run a business.<\/p>\n<p>Chances are that your potential customers already use WhatsApp to communicate, just make it easy for them and watch your sales skyrocket.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>WhatsApp Business app is a great way to engage with your customers and increase sales.
