right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why both small and big businesses take advantage of online marketing to grow their business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So what is Online marketing?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Wikipedia, &#8220;<em>online marketing is a form of marketing and advertising which uses the internet to deliver promotional marketing messages to consumers.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, online marketing is a way to promote your goods and services on the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My question to you is, if people are spending so much time on the internet, <strong>what are they doing?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us try to outline a few of our activities so we can better understand how people use the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People use the internet to;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Read news and follow the latest happenings<\/li><li>Chat with friends on social media like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat<\/li><li>Check and respond to emails<\/li><li>Search for things of interest on Google<\/li><li>Watch videos on YouTube or Vimeo<\/li><li>Play online games<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And much more.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All these activities provide an avenue to sell your products and services to the billions of people using them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding <strong><em>who they are<\/em><\/strong>, <strong><em>where they spend most of their time<\/em><\/strong> and <strong><em>what you&#8217;re going to say to them<\/em><\/strong> is the key to becoming a successful online marketing guru.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why strive to understand online marketing?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses have become reliant on online platforms to convey their messages to consumers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This reliance on online marketing has given rise to a new breed of experts, known as online marketers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online marketers understand how people use the internet and therefore, apply targeted online marketing strategies to help businesses grow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses pay a lot of money to hire the best online marketers because they get the best results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What types of online marketing are available.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Online marketing can take various forms depending on what the business goals or marketing objectives are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your choice of a single online marketing platform or a combination of them depends greatly on the objective of the business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are the most common ones;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Search Engine Marketing (SEM)<\/li><li>Social Media Marketing (SMM)<\/li><li>Content Marketing<\/li><li>Email Marketing<\/li><li>Pay-Per-Click Advertising<\/li><li>Affiliate Marketing<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be hard deciding on which is best to use but understanding where each of them are effective can help you decide quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, I will be providing a detailed explanation on only four of them and their use cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These four include Search Engine Marketing, Social Media Marketing, Content Marketing and Email Marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we start discussing what they are and how they work, it is important to understand two frequently used buzzwords in online advertising.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Impression (CPI).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Cost Per Click (CPC)<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Cost Per Click or CPC as it is commonly referred to is the cost incurred when a person clicks on your advertisement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These can range from a few cents to a couple of dollars based on the keyword or the type of advertisement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although you can specify how much you are willing to pay per click, most online marketing providers will suggest competitive range for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Cost Per Impression (CPI)<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This refers to the cost incured when your advertisement is shown a thousand times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also referred to as Cost per thousand impressions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These can also range from a few cents to a couple of dollars based on the keyword or the type of advertisement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you understand what CPC and CPI means, let&#8217;s move on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Search Engine Marketing (SEM)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartinsights.com\/search-engine-marketing\/search-engine-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Google search alone averaging 3.5bn daily as at 2018 (opens in a new tab)\">Google search alone averaging 3.5bn daily as at 2018<\/a>, we cannot overemphasize the importance of search engine marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SEM involves identifying and promoting keywords that people can use to find your business or service online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term Keyword refers to what people type in a search box when they are looking for your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, there are several free Keyword research tools you can use to identify phrases people use to search for businesses related to yours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do you know when to deploy search engine marketing? Let&#8217;s look at an example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>When to use Search Engine Marketing (SEM)<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s assume you were contacted by a construction company, for simplicity, let&#8217;s call the company XYZ Constructions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>XYZ Constructions just unveiled their new website and they want to drive traffic to the site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are excited about the variety of construction services they offer and they want the world to know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a good use case for search engine marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since most of the people looking for construction companies in their locality will most likely go to Google and search, you can target relevant keywords to drive traffic to their website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is an example using <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"ubersuggest (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/app.neilpatel.com\/en\/ubersuggest\/keyword_ideas?keyword=construction&amp;country=us\" target=\"_blank\">ubersuggest<\/a> for keyword research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/2021\/clickmedia\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/ubersuggest-construction-keyword.jpg\" alt=\"Construction Keyword research on ubersuggest \" class=\"wp-image-204\" width=\"1242\" height=\"915\" srcset=\"https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/ubersuggest-construction-keyword.jpg 1656w, https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/ubersuggest-construction-keyword-300x221.jpg 300w, https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/ubersuggest-construction-keyword-1024x754.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/ubersuggest-construction-keyword-768x566.jpg 768w, https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/ubersuggest-construction-keyword-1536x1132.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/ubersuggest-construction-keyword-1568x1155.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px\" \/><figcaption>Construction Keyword research on ubersuggest <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My advice is to start with a broad keyword such as &#8220;construction&#8221; and then narrow it down to be more specific based on how people are searching.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using long tail keywords will not only help you drive meaningful traffic but also reduce your Cost Per Click.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Social Media Marketing (SMM)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many businesses are benefitting from social media marketing so understanding how it works is very important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media is a great way for businesses to engage with their customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, more businesses are spending money to advertise and grow their social media profiles to foster customer interaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Facebook having the lion share in social media advertising, it&#8217;s no surprise that a lot of businesses focus on Facebook and <a href=\"https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/10-small-businesses-for-instagram-advertising-in-2019\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Instagram advertising (opens in a new tab)\">Instagram advertising<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/2021\/clickmedia\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/social-media-advertising-statistics-by-statista.com_.jpg\" alt=\"Advertising revenues of selected social networks\" class=\"wp-image-198\" width=\"1097\" height=\"686\" srcset=\"https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/social-media-advertising-statistics-by-statista.com_.jpg 1462w, https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/social-media-advertising-statistics-by-statista.com_-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/social-media-advertising-statistics-by-statista.com_-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/clickmedia.com.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/social-media-advertising-statistics-by-statista.com_-768x480.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1097px) 100vw, 1097px\" \/><figcaption>Advertising revenues of selected social networks in the United States from 2015 to 2018 (in million U.S. dollars)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do you know which one works best for what you are trying to sell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These comes down to a couple of things;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The type of content you are promoting.<\/li><li>The type of audience you want to sell to.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Some content fare better than others on different social media platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a short and exciting text to get people talking will do well on Twitter as compared with Facebook or LinkedIn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas a video content will do very well across board.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pictures on the other hand do exceedingly well on Instagram.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So be sure to understand your target audience and the type of content you are putting out to maximise your advertising budget.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media marketing is great for<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Growing a business social media profile to foster interaction and increase social proof.<\/li><li>Drive traffic to a website.<\/li><li>Drive traffic to a social media post.<\/li><li>Getting people engaged on your content.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These and much more explains why social media marketing is very effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Let&#8217;s look at a simple use case.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Going back to our XYZ Construction company example. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine they start a blog where they talk about challenges in the construction business in Lagos Nigeria and how to overcome them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where do you think is best to promote such content? <em>This is a small dive into content marketing.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me give you a second to decide&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, as always, I&#8217;d inquire from the company what their objectives are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing so will help me decide on the best platform to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If their objective is to position themselves as an industry leader in the construction industry, I&#8217;d opt in for LinkedIn advertising.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if they just want to educate people and drive traffic to their blog, I&#8217;d opt in for Facebook advertising.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>So how did i come up with that you might ask? <\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s understand what each of the popular social media networks are great for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block\"><div class=\"schema-faq-section\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">1 &#8211;
